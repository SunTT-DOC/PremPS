## About

<font size=4>

**S921.txt**: the combined independent test set contains 921 single mutations from 54 proteins.

**RS824.txt**: the subset of S921 using all the other mapped redundant experimental structures.

**MS824.txt**: the subset of S921 using modeled structures built by Modeller software.

**Selected Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in S921.

**Redundant Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in RS824.

**Modeled Structures.rar** contains the modeled structures used in MS824.

## Terms in the text files

<font size=4>

PDB Id: The PDB entry of protein.

Mutated Chain: Protein chain with mutation.

Mutation_PDB: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the Protein Data Bank. The first character is one letter amino acid code for the wild-type residue, the second to penultimate characters indicate residue number, and the final character indicates the mutant amino acid.

UniProt: The UniProt ID of protein.

Mutation_UNP: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the protein sequence.

DDGexp: Experimental changes of unfolding Gibbs free energy upon mutations (in kcal/mol).

Location: Location of the mutated site in the protein structure (core or surface).

PremPS: Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by PremPS (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively.

Resolution: Resolution of structures (in Å).

Method: Experimental methods for resolving protein structures including X-ray ("x-ray"), NMR ("nmr") or Cryo-EM ("em").

Aggregate state: Multimeric state of a protein structure including monomer ("mo"), homomer ("ho") and heteromer ("he").

Weight: The molecular weight of a protein structure.

Sequence identity: Sequence identity between target sequences and templates.

RMSD: The root-mean-square deviation between coordinates of all Cα atoms of experimental and modeled structures (in Å).

**The rest of columns are stability changes predicted by methods of INPS3D, INPS, PoPMuSiC, mCSM	and FoldX, respectively (in kcal/mol).**
