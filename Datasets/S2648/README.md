PDB Id: The PDB entry of the protein.

Mutated Chain: Protein chain with mutation.

Mutation_PDB: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the protein databank. The first character is one letter amino acid code for the wild-type residue, the second to penultimate characters indicate residue number, and the final character indicates the mutant amino acid.

UniProt: The UniProt ID of the protein.

Mutation_UNP: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the protein sequence.

DDGexp: Experimental changes of unfolding Gibbs free energy upon mutations (in kcal/mol).

Location: Location of the mutated site on the protein.

PremPS(S2648.txt): Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by retraining the model using S2648 (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively. 

PremPS(CV4)(S2648.txt): Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by retraining and performing "leave-one-protein-out" cross-validation using S2648 (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively. 

PremPS(RS2297.txt, MS2297.txt): Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by PremPS (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively. 

PremPS(CV4)(RS2297.txt, MS2297.txt): Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by PremPS performing "leave-one-protein-out" cross-validation (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively. 

Resolution: Resolution of the crystal structures (in Å).

Method: Experimental method of the crystal structures.

Aggregate state: The aggregate state of the crystal structures.

Weight: Total structure weight of the crystal structures.

Sequence identity: Sequence identity between target sequences and templates.

RMSD: The root mean square deviation of the coordinates of all Cα atoms between crystal and modeled structures (in Å).
