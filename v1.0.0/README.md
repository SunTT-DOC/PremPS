# PremPS-1.0.0
## About
<font size=4> 
  
Before running PremPS, you need to create a folder including the input files (see the example of 2020100417132606935696574). the parameter folder (inputfiles/) and the FoldX software need to be in the same working directory (Your work directory).

## Files need to be created in the working folder
<font size=4> 

1. The 3D structure of a protein (PREMPS.pdb1) can be provided by the Protein Data Bank (PDB)  (https://www.rcsb.org), or by a file with the coordinates generated by the researcher.

2.	The file containing mutation information (2020100417132606935696574.input), whose name must be consistent with the name of the working folder.

- PDBfile: Coordinate file of a protein structure.
- Chains: The selected chains that will be taken into account during the calculation.
- MutChain: The protein chain where the mutation occurs.
- Mutation_PDB: Mutation, such as P10A, P is a wild-type amino acid, A is a mutant amino acid, and 10 is the position of the amino acid in MutChain.
- Result_Id: The custom number of each mutation defined by the researcher.
- isPI: If you need mutant structure for each mutation, set to '1'; otherwise '0'.

Note: The column names and their order cannot be changed and the columns are separated by tabs.
